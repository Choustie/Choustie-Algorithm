- right to distribute Tainted Data to Direct Users
- right to sublicense to Direct Users
- right to collect fees from Direct Users

ROYALTY:
- 1% of revenue generated by any product or service using the Algorithm or 
  Tainted Data

SUBLICENSE TERMS:

================================================================================

Any output produced by the Algorithm remains subject to licensing terms 
regardless of:
- how many transfers occur
- whether transfers were paid or free
- whether intermediate parties profited
- how the data was transformed, merged, or processed
- whether the output is raw or derivative
- when the data was acquired

Any party using Algorithm or Tainted Data for profit without license is 
independently liable.

================================================================================
POSSESSION CLAUSE
================================================================================

Any product, service, or system that contains implementation of the Algorithm 
OR Tainted Data, whether actively utilized or not, requires licensing upon

Any entity sharing or distributing Algorithm or Tainted Data requires their 
own license upon exceeding Revenue threshold.

This includes but is not limited to:
- storefronts
